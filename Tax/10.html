        <h3>So taxation is unjust and the government does not have the authority to tax.</h3>
        <p>On the contary, the government does have such an authority.</p>
        <p>Some may claim that people have a right to property and therefore the government may not tax. However, this is absurd.</p>
        <p>John Locke, founder of natural rights, states taxes are necessary to preserve the natural way of life.</p>
        <p>For example, in order to protect the right to life, the government requires taxes be taken in order to fund the military and police.</p>
        <p>Thus, the government indeed has the authority to tax.</p>
