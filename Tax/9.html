        <h3>So taxation is unjust, and the government has the authority to tax, yet such tax is detrimental to society.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case. Some things cannot be accomplished effectively merely by free trade. For example, the army of a country which is composed entirely of mercenaries has little incentive to protect a country they do not belong to. This is seen most clearly when the Hessian mercenaries failed to defend an area of British territory from the Patriots.</p>
        <p>Thus, it would appear taxation can indeed be beneficial to society, like to conscript troops from the population to create a People's Army.</p>
