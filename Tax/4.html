        <h3>So taxation is just and is beneficial for society.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case. Take for example a common use of funds, building infrastructure.</p>
        <p>If the government seizes funds to build infrastructure, it may be done inefficiently and cost more than it needed to, because the government has no incentive to build efficiently or maintain the roads.</p>
        <p>Another case may be providing welfare, or some other redistribution of wealth.</p>
        <p>If this was the case, people would have an incentive to intentionally work less so as to lower their income and receive money from people that do more work.</p>
        <p>Thus, it is not beneficial to society to have any kind of collectivization or to give money to an entity without incentive to be efficient.</p>
