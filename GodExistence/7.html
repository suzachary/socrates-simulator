        <h3>So God does not exist.</h3>
        <h3>Objects are a certain way. We can say that their current properties are their actual properties, or "act." Objects also have the potential to be other ways. These are their potential properties, or "potency." For example, a red rubber ball is <i>actually</i> red, bouncy, and smooth. It has the <i>potential</i> to be blue if I paint it. We can say that when I paint the red ball blue, I have "reduced" its potency to be blue to an act of being blue.</h3>
        <h3>Can potency reduce potency to act?</h3>
