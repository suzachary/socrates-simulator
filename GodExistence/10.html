        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can be reduced to act by another act in an infinitely regressing chain.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be.</p>
        <p>Firstly, science would suggest that only a finite amount of objects can effect a given object in such a chain. If one has an infinite amount of existing objects, one involves themselves in paradoxes that defy all logic.</p>
        <p>One example of such paradoxes is Hilbert's Hotel. In Hilbert's Hotel, there are an infinite number of rooms. Hilbert's Hotel also has an infinite number of guests, and thus every room is full. If a new person arrives asking for a room, all Hilbert needs to do is ask every guest to move from their current room <i>n</i> to the room <i>n</i> + 1. Allowing a guest to have a room when all the rooms are full is clearly a paradox.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, there can only be a finite amount of objects and so the chain of movement, which consists of actual objects, cannot be infinite.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, to suggest that something can move because an infinite number of moved movers (the wrist, muscles, etc.) are moving it is akin to saying that a paintbrush can move without a hand as long as the paintbrush is of infinite length. This is absurd.</p>
        <p>Thus, it would appear that the chain of movement cannot infinitely regress.</p>
