        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can be reduced to act by another act in a finite chain of movement that ends with an object consisting of potency and act.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be. For if such an object were to end the chain of movement, it would have to move itself, which is not posssible. How can something potentially blue have itself move itself to be blue? Its potential cannot move itself to be blue for potential cannot enact change. Its actual non-blueness cannot move itself to be blue because it does not contain the color blue.</p>
        <p>In fact, this is like saying that a series of train cars without engines, each pulled by the next, can all be pulled by another train car with a train car without an engine at the front.</p>
        <p>Thus, it is not possible that a chain of finite movement can end with an object consisting of potency and act.</p>
