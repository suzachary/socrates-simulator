        <h3>So God does not exist and potency can be reduced to act by another act.</h3>
        <h3>Let us take the example where I move my hand up. In order to do that, I must reduce the potency of my hand to be up to act. In order to do that, I must <i>simultaneously</i> move my wrist in the same way (reducing the potency of my wrist to be up). In order to do that, I must <i>simultaneously</i> move muscles and nerves and electric impulses and so on. Can this chain of movement go on forever?</h3>
