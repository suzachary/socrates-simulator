        <h3>So both the mind and material can have specific meaning.</h3>
        <p>However, it is hard to see that this would be the case.</p>
        <p>Take for example a picture of a triangle. That triangle has no meaning on its own. Someone might say that it indicates a pyramid, another says it indicates the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter, and another says it indicates the presence of the Illuminati. Whatever the case, the triangle itself has no meaning; rather, the individuals attach meaning to it.</p>
        <p>Even words by themselves have no meaning. We are the ones that attach meaning to the splotches of ink on the paper.</p>
        <p>Thus, it would seem material cannot have specific meaning. Therefore we reach a contradiction.</p>
