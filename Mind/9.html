        <h3>So the mind is immaterial and finite, and AI will reach the heights of the human intellect.</h3>
        <p>If AI will truly reach the heights of the human intellect, then we will have a fully material thing (artificial intelligence) that can model human intelligence.</p>
        <p>If we examine the brain, we will see that it is composed of neurons and electrical signals which form the senses and thought process we understand to be the mind. We know that the mind is solely material because we can recreate a human mind using a fully material thing.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the mind is material. We reach a contradiction.</p>
