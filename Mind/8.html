        <h3>So human intelligence is immaterial and infinite.</h3>
        <p>However, it would seem that human intelligence is in all ways finite. We can only sense so many things and our minds can only handle so much sensory input. For example, we cannot see infinitely far or in the back of our heads.</p>
        <p>In addition, we cannot always interpret such sensory data correctly. A shadow in the dark which appears to be a person reveals itself to be a pile of clothes on a chair. Optical illusions trick our minds in various ways.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, our human rationality is in many ways flawed, or else all humans would instantly reach the same conclusion on any matter of reasoning.</p>
        <p>If human intelligence is indeed limited, we have reached a contradiction.</p>
