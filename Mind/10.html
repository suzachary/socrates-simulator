        <h3>So the mind is immaterial and finite, yet AI will never reach the heights of the human intellect.</h3>
        <p>On the contrary, it would appear artificial intelligence will eventually reach the heights of the human intellect.</p>
        <p>Technology is constantly improving. It rarely is ever set back, and historically, when it has, it has always improved afterwards. If technology constantly improves, then assuming that the human race survives long enough, then technology will eventually be able to model any finite phenomena.</p>
        <p>If technology can model any finite phenomena, and the mind itself is finite, then technology can model the mind.</p>
        <p>Thus, we reach a conclusion.</p>
