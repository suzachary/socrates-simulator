        <h3>So the mind is material and cannot have specific meaning.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case. Let's say for example that we know the following statement is true: "if p, then q." Now, if I were to tell you that "p" is true, one can say that "q" must indeed be true. You have just used <i>modus ponens</i>, a logical function that says that if "if p, then q" is given, then when p is true, q is also true.</p>
        <p>This logical function has unambiguous conceptual content. Thus, we have reached a contradiction.</p>
