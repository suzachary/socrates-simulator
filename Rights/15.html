        <h3>So human rights do not exist, and something is good to the extent that it is actual, yet humans do not have a final end.</h3>
        <p>On the contrary, all things have a final end.</p>
        <p>It is clear that things have an inherent tendency to do certain things. A match, when struck, will always burn with fire. A heart, in a functioning body, will always pump blood. Thus, they move towards some end. This is what a final cause is.</p>
