        <h3>So human rights exist and the government or other people form an absolute authority.</h3>
        <p>Take for example the United States. At one point in time, the United States government allowed for slavery. However, nowadays, that same United States government sees that viewpoint as incorrect. However, this means that the government disagrees with itself.</p>
        <p>An absolute authority must agree with itself at all times. If an authority disagreed with itself, then that means that it was wrong at one point. This means the authority in question was not absolute.</p>
        <p>Because all governments in history have changed their minds or disagreed with themselves, no government is absolute. No government can be an absolute authority.</p>
        <p>This same logic applies to other people, who also contradict themselves and change their minds.</p>
        <p>Thus, we reach a contradiction.</p>
