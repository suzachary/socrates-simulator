        <h3>So human rights exist and there exists either a conflicting set of absolute authorities or no absolute authority.</h3>
        <p>If there is a set of conflicting absolute authorities, there is no authoritive declaration because multiple conflicting declarations cannot possibly be true.</p>
        <p>If there is no absolute authority, then there is no absolutely authoritatively true declaration.</p>
        <p>If there be no absolutely authoritative true declaration, there can be no universal title over all humans, which means there can be no rights.</p>
