        <h3>So human rights exist and God is an absolute authority, yet has not espoused human rights directly.</h3>
        <p>Let's say you are deist. If you are indeed deist, is there any reason to believe that God espoused human rights? Anything authoritative about the nature of God would have to come through a divine revelation that contradicts deism. Thus we arrive at a contradiction: either deism is false or human rights do not necessarily exist.</p>
        <p>If you are a member of the Abrahamic Religions and do not have human rights explicitly in your religion, then we must look at the specific texts of the Abrahamic Religions. For example, God says that murder is immoral. Thus, we may say that there is an implicit right to life. If theft is also immoral, then there is a right to property. However, freedom of speech, right to bear arms, etc. are not real rights explicitly espoused in the religious texts of the Abrahamic Religions. So to an extent, human rights do exist. You win. The only way to argue this is by arguing against the authority of God Himself. See our entry on the existence of God.</p>
        <p>If you are a member of a religion that does not explicitly declare human rights, what can be said about the Abrahamic Religions can most likely be said about that religion as well (Confucianism, Buddhism, etc.).</p>
