        <h3>So human rights do not exist, something is good to the extent that it is actual, and humans have a final end.</h3>
        <p>However, if humans indeed have a final end, then it is clear that the preservation of life is a part of that final end. For all humans have a natural instinct to preserve life. And since something is good to the extent that it is actual, to be actual is to be good. To fulfill one's final end is to be actual. Thus, to fulfill one's final end—the preservation of life—is to be good. And therefore we prove that murder and killings are immoral, implying a right to life.</p>
