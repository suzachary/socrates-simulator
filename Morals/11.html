        <h3>So objective morality exists.</h3>
        <h3>Can one connect an "is" to an "ought"?</h3>
        <h4>An "is" is a statement about the real world, such as "it is raining" or "I am tired." An "ought" is a statement of morality, such as "one ought not to kill" or "one ought not to steal."</h4>
