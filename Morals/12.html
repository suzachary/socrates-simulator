        <h3>So objective morality exists and one can connect an "is" to an "ought."</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case.</p>
        <p>Consider the statement "one ought not to kill." How can one connect this to an is? One might say that "killing hurts people" or that "you shouldn't take away someone's life if they do not wish it." However, going from one of these statements to stating that the action of killing is objectively bad is simply a non-sequitor. Therefore, it is hard to see how objective morality could exist since one cannot prove an ought using rational means and observation of the world.</p>
