        <h3>So objective morality exists, yet one cannot connect an "is" to an "ought".</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be.</p>
        <p>If one cannot connect an "is" to an "ought" then morality cannot be determined by anything other than one's feelings. The reason for this is that reality and descriptions of "is" are objective while feelings vary from person to person. But if morality is based off of feelings, which vary from person to person, then it must be that morals vary from person to person. However, if morality is objective, it cannot vary from person to person.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we reach a contradiction.</p>
