        <h3>So morality exists and is subjective.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be.</p>
        <p>By stating that morality exists, one is saying that it is a real feature of the world, which means it corresponds to some truth. For example, stating that this screen is real means that the screen corresponds to a truly existing thing in the world.</p>
        <p>Now, truth cannot contradict truth. If one statement contradicts another, that means that at least one statement is incorrect.</p>
        <p>If morality is subjective, it varies from person to person. However, these senses of morality cannot all be correct, for these different moralities contradict each other. Therefore, if morality exists, it cannot be subjective.</p>
        <p>Thus we reach a contradiction.</p>
