        <h3>So the death penalty is unjust, some people cannot be rehabilitated and made better and there is a benefit to society for keeping such people in jail.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case. If such people cannot be reformed, they will never improve while they are in jail. Furthermore, to prevent such evil people from harming others, excessive security must be required, costing taxpayers money. Thus it would appear there is no benefit for keeping such people in jail.</p>
