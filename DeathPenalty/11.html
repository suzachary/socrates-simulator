        <h3>So some people cannot be rehabilitated and made better yet such people gain some benefit or have some right to stay in jail.</h3>
        <p>However, this cannot be the case. It cannot benefit a person to do evil, and since there is no hope for them to be rehabilitated and stop doing evil, there can be no benefit for them.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, they would appear not to have the right to stay in jail, for this would imply that they have the right to life. However this cannot be the case because as Locke, the creator of the concept of natural rights, states that people, upon violating the social contract and doing evil, forfeit their rights.</p>
        <p>Thus, such people gain no benefit and have no right to stay in jail.</p>
