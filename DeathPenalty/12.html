        <h3>So the death penalty is unjust, some people cannot be rehabilitated and made better, there is no benefit to society or the person being punished for such people to stay in jail and they have no right to stay in jail.</h3>
        <p>If this is the case, then it seems perfectly morally licit to use the death penalty. People must be punished someway for extreme crimes, and there is no reason not to use the death penalty.</p>
