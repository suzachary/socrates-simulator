        <h3>So the Ship of Theseus is different from the new ship, yet you are a different person.</h3>
        <p>However, this would appear to be absurd. If you are a different person than you were when you were born, then there is no sense in referring to you by the person that was created when you were born. In this sense, you were created out of nothing. Thus, this view would appear to be a contradiction.</p>
