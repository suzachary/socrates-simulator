        <h3>So the new ship is the same Ship of Theseus and form determines identity. Additionally, two identically made ships are the same ship.</h3>
        <p>If this is the case, then there would be no individuals within one category of things. For example, it makes no sense to say that all Ticonderoga pencils are the same pencil. Clearly there are different pencils, and therefore there are different things. If each pencil is a different thing, it must have a different identity. However, if form is the only thing that determines identity and two identical things are the same thing, then this would suggest that all pencils are the same thing.</p>
        <p>Because all pencils are one thing, but at the same time there are different pencils, we reach a contradiction.</p>
