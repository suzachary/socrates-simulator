        <h3>So the new ship is the same Ship of Theseus, yet identity is determined by matter.</h3>
        <p>If matter is what determines a thing's identity, then the Ship of Theseus cannot be the same.</p>
        <p>We know for sure that the original ship is indeed the Ship of Theseus. This ship is composed materially of the old, rotting wood. If every part of the ship is replaced, then there is none of this old, rotting wood left. This means that the material of the ship is entirely different. Because material determines identity, that means that the identity of the ship is entirely different. Therefore, the new ship cannot be the same Ship of Theseus. Thus we reach a contradiction.</p>
