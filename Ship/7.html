        <h3>So the Ship of Theseus is different from the new ship, and you are the same person as you were when you were born.</h3>
        <p>If you are the same person as you were when you were born, that suggests that something remains the same thing even despite changes in matter. All the cells which composed the "you" when you were born are now gone and replaced with new cells. This suggests that something's identity results from simply tracing historical origin. If this is indeed the case, then the new ship, which can trace its historical origin back to the original Ship of Theseus, is the same ship. Thus we reach a contradiction.</p>
