        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment in which Theseus, the mythical hero, has his wooden ship rotting away in a harbor. Each piece of the ship is replaced, one by one, with a new wooden piece in the same shape.</p>
        <h3>Is the new ship, with the new wooden pieces, the same ship?</h3>
        <button onclick="window.location.href = '1.html'" class="answerbtn">Yes, this is the same Ship of Theseus.</button>
        <button onclick="window.location.href = '6.html'" class="answerbtn">No, this is a different ship from the Ship of Theseus.</button>
