        <h3>So God cannot have emotions yet is omnibenevolent.</h3>
        <p>If God is indeed omnibenevolent, then He desires good. The desire for good is what causes happiness (when goodness is obtained) and sorrow (when goodness is lost). Therefore, it appears that God would have emotion out of a desire for good. Thus we reach a contradiction.</p>
